# Conversation Assistant

Helping you find the right words.

I reckon I need some prefilled stuff on the frontend, such as the tone of the conversation.  I'm not sure what I should do when all inputs are empty.  

I should do a toLowerCase in the frontend when sending this stuff?  Probs doesn't matter.

Dropdown options:
Relationship:
- Friend (default)
- Mother
- Father
- Girlfriend
- Boyfriend
- Partner
- Crush
- Wife
- Husband
- Enemy
- (custom)


Tone:
- Casual (default)
- Professional
- Flirty
- Serious
(custom)

I can be described as:
- Funny
- Charming
- Mysterious
- 

I want to be able to get good suggestions right off the bat, without filling out any details.
