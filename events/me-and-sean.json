Facebook is built with PHP.\n\nNode is more popular, and I think you would be better off sticking with that (if you want).  \n\nWordPress allows you to build a rich website full of features with virtually zero coding.  I have a WordPress site and I've never written PHP before.  If your goal is to set up a small-medium scale Ecommerce website, then I would definitely stick with WordPress.",

I hope next year things get back to normal ðŸ˜”\n\nThanks for your feedback!ðŸŒŸ\n\nI have come to the same conclusion. \nI might just stick to Wordpress with what I have, and avoid php, which is simple enough to learn but I just donâ€™t have enough time..and play with node.js for my own amusement ðŸ˜†",
